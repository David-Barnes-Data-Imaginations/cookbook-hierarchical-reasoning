    "prompt": "In a Modigliani-Miller world with no taxes, Firm U is unlevered with an EBIT of $100,000 in perpetuity and a 10% cost of capital. Firm L is identical but has $200,000 in debt at a 5% interest rate. A trader notices Firm L is being valued at $1,100,000. If an investor owns 10% of Firm L's equity, they can prove the valuation is inefficient by switching to Firm U using 'homemade leverage' (borrowing 10% of Firm L's debt amount).
