    "prompt": "Two machines in a factory produce widgets. Machine A produces 80 widgets per hour with a defect rate of 2.5%, while Machine B produces 120 widgets per hour with a defect rate of 4%. Both machines operate for 5 hours. If a quality inspector randomly selects 50 widgets from the combined production, what is the expected number of defective widgets in the sample, and what is the standard deviation of this number? Give your answer as 'expected, standard deviation' rounded to two decimal places each.",

    "prompt": "A call center receives calls at a rate that varies by time: 30 calls per hour from 9 AM to 12 PM, 45 calls per hour from 12 PM to 2 PM, and 25 calls per hour from 2 PM to 5 PM. Each call handler can process calls at a rate of 8 calls per hour. If 12% of all calls result in a sale, and each sale generates $45 in revenue, calculate the minimum number of call handlers needed to ensure that the probability of having more than 5 calls waiting at any given moment during peak hours (12 PM to 2 PM) is less than 10%, using the Poisson approximation.",
